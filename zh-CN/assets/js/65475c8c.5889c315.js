However, after reviewing the commit logs of many open-source projects, we found an interesting problem: some developers have good code quality, but their commit messages are messy. When other contributors or learners view the code, they cannot intuitively understand the purpose of the changes before and after the commit. As Peter Hutterer said: Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator.
